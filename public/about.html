<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Ramjanak. I’m passionate about learning and building skills that help me grow both personally and
professionally. I enjoy exploring new technologies, especially in web development, and I love creating projects that
solve real-world problems. </p>

<p>Outside of coding, I’m interested in cricket, anime, and continuous self-improvement. I believe in staying consistent,
working hard, and balancing discipline with curiosity. My goal is to keep learning, expand my skills, and eventually
build a meaningful career in the tech industry. </p>

<p>When I’m not working or studying, you can usually find me experimenting with new ideas, reading, or spending time
improving my fitness. I see challenges as opportunities, and I’m always excited about what’s ahead in the journey.</p>
