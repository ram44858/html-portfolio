<h1>The Best Movies According to Ram Janak</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption (1994)</h3>
<p>Widely considered one of the best films ever made, it tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker wrongly imprisoned for murder, and his friendship with Red. The movie is slow but deeply rewarding, filled with themes of hope, resilience, and redemption. Morgan Freeman’s narration is unforgettable.</p>
<h3>Your Name (Kimi no Na wa, 2016)</h3>
<p>A breathtakingly animated Japanese film by Makoto Shinkai. It follows two teenagers who mysteriously swap bodies and slowly develop a connection that transcends time and space. The visuals are stunning, the soundtrack is emotional, and the story blends romance, humor, and tragedy beautifully.</p>
<h3>Interstellar (2014)</h3>
<p>Christopher Nolan’s epic explores love, time, and survival as astronauts travel through a wormhole to save humanity. With mind-blowing visuals of space, emotional father-daughter moments, and a scientifically inspired storyline, it mixes science with deep emotions. Hans Zimmer’s organ-based score is haunting.</p>
